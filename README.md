# Projet_Simulation

### Here is a 2d gravitation simulation project.

### This program contains 3 basic simulations:
- The solar system on January 1, 2022 (based on the ecliptic)
- A simulation without any object
- A simulation showing 50 random objects orbiting each other

## Settings Options :
#### <ins>Languages : </ins>
- French 
- English
#### <ins>Video Settings :</ins>
The following list represents options that we can Enable or Disable,

- Textures ( Draw detailed texture instead of a single color if the object has one )
- Cycles ( Display the number of ticks instead of the time since the beginning of the simulation )     
- Version display 
- Mouse coordinates display 
- Fps display 
- Trajectories display ( Display the path taken by all the objects )
- Visible object ( Draw a colored dot if the object is too small )

#### <ins>Keybord Controls :</ins>
-    P    | simulation choice 
-  Escape | exit the program
-  Space  | pause / play the simulation 
- Up/Down | Increase or Decrease Simulation speed ( more precision )
-    A    | Create a new object 
## Additional features :
You can click on all objects to see their characteristics  
You can zoom and move the camera with the mouse buttons
